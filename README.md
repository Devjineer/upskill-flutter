# UpSkill Flutter

This repository marks my journey into learning mobile app development with flutter. It will carry, the lessons, progress as I build apps one at a time. This will be in phases.

## Phases

While I might not know how many phases this will be at the end, but one thing is for sure, the beginner phase


### Phase 1 (Beginner)

- This is me getting accustomed with the dart programming language syntax used for flutter app development. You will find this in the **./01-syntax**:
   - 01-variables.dart
   - 02-func.dart
   - 03-list.dart
   - 04-map.dart
   - 05-control.dart
   - 06-loops.dart
   - 07-classes.dart

   ```bash
      dart run <path to file>
   ```
